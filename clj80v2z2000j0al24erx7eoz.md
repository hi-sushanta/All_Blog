Welcome to the end-to-end deep learning guide. In this article, I explain every step you need to train your neural network. After finishing this article you build your first deep learning model from <s>scratch</s> In PyTorch This is my promise to you. Now let’s begin.

Note 🔥— This is not a blog post that you read. It is a note that I took several years ago when I first came to this field. I am sharing it with everyone today in the hope that it will help your journey.

**Who Is This Article 📌**

* People who are curious about how deep learning works and learn how to build models that solve world problems in the real world.
    
* People who are curious about learning the most important skill in 21 st century.
    
* People who don’t fear math notation. Math is the foundation of deep learning knowing helps you talk to other deep learning researchers.
    

**Requirement 📌**

* GPU
    
* Know how to use LLMs model like ( ChatGPT & Bard ), because this type of model is helpful for learning.
    
* Know how to write Python Class, Function *( …/… )*, and some basic of library like ( [*NumPy*](https://hiwhy.io/numpy-complete-guide), [*Matplotlib*](https://hiwhy.io/matplotlib-complete-guide) )
    

**Goal Of This Airtcle🎯**

* Why and where use deep learning.
    
* Write your own code not copy others. Understand every step of what you write and why you write.
    

I know this article covers a lot of material, but I promise it's fun to learn. If you need help understanding something in the article, please feel free to [ask](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sushanta-das-/) me in a comment below. I'm always happy to help.

## What Is Deep Learning

> *“A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” —****Arthur Lee Samuel***

When you ask someone or search Google🔍 ( what is deep learning ? ) you find so many different types of answers, sometimes easy or sometimes hard to understand. I know this because I face the same problem some years ago in my journey.

You already know [‘machine learning’](https://hiwhy.io/complete-machine-learning-guide) is a field we develop intelligent machines that can learn and interact with humans. The same is deep learning — a subfield of machine learning, but deep learning use of ANN ( artificial neural network ) that inspires our human brain. It takes fast time confusing but trusts me, I explain one by one, just read!

The Goal of ‘machine learning’ and ‘deep learning’ is to build powerful intelligent ‘artificial intelligence ( AI ) ’. At this time many people think, is human replaced by a computer? The short answer is ‘not’ because you don't know how powerful our brain is..

Ignore 😡 — When someone says you ‘AI replace human’ don’t talk this type of people. Because they don’t know anything about it.
