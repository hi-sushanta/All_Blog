When come to deep learning many definitions have sometimes easy and sometimes hard to understand. So in this article, I explain complex topics easily so anyone can understand this field easily.

## What Is Deep Learning — Simple Definition

You already know deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. Deep learning uses an algorithm called Artificial Neural Networks ( ANNs ) and this algorithm is inspired by our human brain. 🧠

![Deep neural network](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687402192795/a2cb4cd2-5972-4f60-9a19-5711baf13bab.png align="center")

**In simple terms**— These networks are structured to accept some input and process this input and then deliver some output.

Example 🔥: Human analogy 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

**You —** Asked your friend hi can you help me complete my search engine project.

**Friend** — Think, Okay why not. But tomorrow because I am going to the hospital today. Because my mother health is not good.

One thing noticed is, Your friend’s think *(* ***that is called processing input*** *)* and your friend’s answer is output. The same is this neural network, no more complex. You give some input and the neural network processes this input and the result you get is some output. This input processing works **layer by layer** in a network. In the upcoming lesson, I write in-depth in layers. Not keep in mind. 😢

### Why Called Deep Neural Network

Suppose you build an application that predicts whether someone [**Covid19 or not**](https://hiwhy.io/covid-19-deep-learning-model). So you collect data and train the neural network. The more **“hidden”** layer you put in your neural network the more deep network is. In simple terms the more hidden layer the deeper. And that is cause this field’s name is Deep learning.

When I talk about deep learning meaning I specifically talk about artificial neural networks. The goal of the neural network learns from **Feature data** and make a prediction.

Suppose you build an application to make a prediction **Cat or Dog**. So as a deep learning developer collect a large amount of Cat and Dog images.

One thing remember deep learning needs a large amount of data sometimes called big data. When data is collected next step is to [**analyze this data**](https://hiwhy.io/pandas-in-python-complete-guide) so our data is clean and useful. The third step is to create a neural network and train this data. In this case, **Cat & Dog** is two feature our network learn. After our neural network learning is complete next step is to make a prediction so you confirm our model learns these features properly. 👌🏻

We are very lucky because we have the opportunity to create machines for our goal. So the question is what is your goal?

## Supervised Vs Unsupervised Learning

In deep learning, machines learn these two ways— **Supervised** and **Unsupervised**. In machine learning **supervised learning,** you have label data and in **unsupervised learning**, you don’t have label data. This topic, I write about later, so one thing to remember.

![3 square box explain two type of deep learning exapmple Supervised and unsupervised](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687402200811/9f7528b8-84af-4f90-b157-b9153b8cc3d2.png align="center")

**Note** 🔥: Supervised time you train neural network label data meaning. Suppose you build an application that predicts whether this is a human face or not. So as a deep learning developer collect human face data and train this data neural network. In this case, your neural network knows the label is a human face.

But this opposite is unsupervised time. You collect lots of face data and your job is to make a prediction face. Whether is human or animal means your data is no label. That time you provided face data in a neural network and your deep learning model learn itself. Because models don’t know what human and animal faces are like is so deep learning models divided this data it’s called clustering!

In deep learning many different kinds of artificial neural networks have Convolution Neural Networks ( CNN ), Recurrent Neural Networks ( RNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN ), Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-Networks, and many more! But one particular field this time extremely popular and that is Computer Vision…

## What Is Computer Vision

In simple terms, Computer Vision(CV) is the field we teach machines the ability to understand visual data ( Images, Videos ). Think of this Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) is a brain and Computer Vision(CV) is the eye machine. 🤖

Some of the popular computer vision application is Self-driving car in Tesla, Facebook image recognition, Amazon Go Shopping so on…

### Why Computer Vision Important Today

One of the main reasons computer vision is important modern world is Big Data. Data is a new asset for both the company and personal. You know every day millions of images and videos upload on Social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube. And that type of company doesn’t have enough employers manually analyze this data. So this type of company builds an AI model and this model automatically analysis this data.

Many reasons computer vision is important today here are some of I write

* Every year so many people died in car accidents.
    
* Many people die from Cancer because doctors don’t find any clue before.
    
* Every Country Border.
    
* Night Security Guard job — Sleep is important but this thing is not to apply low pay salary people.
