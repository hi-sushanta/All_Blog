In this article, you learn how to create an Object detection model in just 5 minutes using the YOLOv8 model.

Now let‚Äôs get started üí•

## What Is YOLOv8

[**YOLOv8**](https://ultralytics.com/yolov8) is a real-time object detection model developed by Ultralytics company. This is a new family member YOLO. After a long time of research and hard work company build the best Object detection, segmentation, and classification model in the world. The Company goal is to make AI everyone.

### Why You Use YoloV8

At this time best computer vision model is available on earth. It‚Äôs open-source and beginner friendly. The best thing about this model is it‚Äôs a community, whatever you have a problem you found instant answers because it‚Äôs a very active community.

## How To Use YOLOv8

You can use YOLOv8 for the PyCharm environment ‚Äî the first step is to install YOLOv8 package and then go to write code in PyCharm

A new version of YOLOv8 provides both, a command line interface (CLI) and Python SDK for performing training, validation, and inference. But this time I am only using the pre-trained model and detecting objects.

Install the `Ultralytics package` for your terminal.üí•

```python

# Install the ultralytics package and it automatically installs the latest version

pip install ultralytics
```

### Write Code In PyCharm

After the download is complete. And now the main exciting part comes from is 4 lines of code to complete your **Object Detection project**.

Open your **PyCharm IDE** and create a new Python file. Write this code below.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

YOLO_MODEL_PATH = r"C:\Users\hiwhy\OneDrive\Documents\Blog_post\YOLO-FAMILY\YOLOv8-Article\yolov8s.pt"

model = YOLO(YOLO_MODEL_PATH)

model.predict(source="0", show=True,conf=0.80)
```

### Understand Above Code What I Write

Writing without understanding code is like Gambling. You are a **Computer Vision developer**, not a Gambler. üôÖüèª

Now let‚Äôs understand code! üí•

**First Line ‚Äî** I import the **Ultralytics package** because i am using the **YOLOv8** model.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
```

**Second Line ‚Äî** Load pre-trained model.ü§ñ

```python
# Path specify which area to download the YOLO model. 

YOLO_MODEL_PATH = r"C:\Users\hiwhy\OneDrive\Documents\Blog_post\YOLO-FAMILY\YOLOv8-Article\yolov8s.pt"

model = YOLO(YOLO_MODEL_PATH)
```

**The Third Step** ‚Äî is to use `predict( )` function in the YOLOv8 model.

```python
# source: video file path or 0 mean access my webcam
# show: True Display the output or False mean doesn't display.
# conf: It is a confidence level specified. if above the conf level then draw the object.
# save: if it's specified to True mean save this output locally. and if false means don't save.

model.predict(source='demo_video.mp4',show=True, conf=0.60,save=True) # Using video to detect object.

# OR
# model.predict(source="0", show=True,conf=0.60,save=True) acess webcam and detect object.
```

### In Summary

* **YoloV8** is a very fast and accurate model available on earth in object detection.
    
* Use this command in your terminal to install this package `pip install ultralytics`
