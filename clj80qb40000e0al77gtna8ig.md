## What Real-World Problem We Are Solve Using Deep Learning

When you order food these types of companies such as **JustEat, DoorDash, Zomato, Swiggy** and etc. This company provides you delivery person‚Äôs name, mobile number, and how much time it takes for delivery successfully. Most people already guess which thing to solve in this article.

Our job is to build a deep learning model to predict how much time it takes for delivery successful based on past data.

</div>

In this dataset under 11 columns and each of these columns is under **45593** value store.

This column represents as a delivery partner how much time to take for delivery successful in the past days.

Now look closely at each of these columns ‚§µÔ∏è

* `ID` ‚Äî It‚Äôs unique and the order Id number.
    
* `Delivery_person_ID` ‚Äî It is the unique ID number of the Delivery partner.
    
* `Delivery_person_Age` ‚Äî This is the actual age of the delivery partner
    
* `Delivery_person_Rating` ‚Äî It‚Äôs a rating of the delivery partner based on past deliveries.
    
* `Resturant_latitude` ‚Äî It‚Äôs the latitude of the Restaurant.
    
* `Resturant_longitude` ‚Äî It‚Äôs longitude of Resturant.
    
* `Delivery_location_latitude` ‚Äî It‚Äôs the latitude of actual delivery locations
    
* `Delivery_location_longetude` ‚Äî It‚Äôs longetude of actual delivery locations.
    
* `Type_of_order` ‚Äî This is a type of meal ordered by a customer.
    
* `Type_of_vehicle` ‚Äî This is a type of vehicle delivery partner ride on.
    
* `Time_taken(min)` ‚Äî It‚Äôs the actual time taken by a delivery partner to complete this order.
    

Import Some **Require Libary** we need solve this problem.

```

## Load Data Into Panda DataFrame

Now time to move on and load data into [**pandas DataFrame**](https://hiwhy.io/complete-pandas-guide/). Use the `read_csv ( )` function to read the `txt file` as well.

```python
dataframe = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/new_article/FoodDeleveryTimePrediction/deliverytimehistory.txt")
dataframe
```

![Google Colab output](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687402144796/6105266d-1d90-4ade-9389-caa9221e5acc.png align="left")

Use the `info( )` method in pandas to display dataFrame information. ‚§µÔ∏è

```python
dataframe.info()
```

![Google Colab output in pandas dataframe](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687402147123/7a273151-8829-4a05-929a-ff00a42db97a.png align="center")

Make sure our dataset does not have any null value. ‚§µÔ∏è

```python
dataframe.isnull().sum()
```

![Google colab output in pandas dataframe ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687402149179/2a11be3d-90a6-428d-966e-67573f87cd47.png align="center")

If you see our dataset doesn‚Äôt have any null value. Now move next section!

### **Insert New Distance Column in DataFrame üó∫Ô∏è**

In this section, I create a small function to calculate the distance between the restaurant and the delivery location.

I am also adding the `distance column` in my pandas dataFrame! üêº

```python
# Set the earth's radius value (in kilometers)
R = 6371

# Convert degrees to radians
def degree_to_radians(degrees):
    return degrees * (np.pi/180)

# Using herversine formula to calculate the distance between to points
def distcalculate(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    d_lat = degree_to_radians(lat2-lat1)
    d_lon = degree_to_radians(lon2-lon1)
    a = np.sin(d_lat/2)**2 + np.cos(degree_to_radians(lat1)) * np.cos(degree_to_radians(lat2)) * np.sin(d_lon/2)**2
    c = 2 * np.arctan2(np.sqrt(a), np.sqrt(1-a))
    return R * c
  
# Calculate the distance between each pair of points
dataframe['distance'] = np.nan

for i in range(len(dataframe)):
    dataframe.loc[i, 'distance'] = distcalculate(dataframe.loc[i, 'Restaurant_latitude'], 
                                        dataframe.loc[i, 'Restaurant_longitude'], 
                                        dataframe.loc[i, 'Delivery_location_latitude'], 
                                        dataframe.loc[i, 'Delivery_location_longitude'])
```

The above step is complete now display the dataFrame and see what looks like the distance column.

```python
dataframe
```

### Display Relationship Between Distance And Time

At this time I am using the [**matplotlib library**](https://hiwhy.io/matplotlib-complete-guide) to display the relationship between two columns such as `distance and time`. See the code below!

```python
figure = px.scatter(data_frame = dataframe, 
                    x="distance",
                    y="Time_taken(min)", 
                    size="Time_taken(min)", 
                    trendline="expanding" ,
                    title = "Relationship Between Distance and Time")
figure.show()
```

### Display Relationship Between Time And Age

Once again see the relationship between the time and age column.

```python
figure = px.scatter(data_frame = dataframe, 
                    x="Delivery_person_Age",
                    y="Time_taken(min)", 
                    size="Time_taken(min)", 
                    color = "distance",
                    trendline="ols", 
                    title = "Relationship Between Time and Age")
figure.show()
```

### Display Relationship Between Time and Ratings

Again to see the relationship between time and rating. üåüüåü‚è±Ô∏è

```python
figure = px.scatter(data_frame = dataframe, 
                    x="Delivery_person_Ratings",
                    y="Time_taken(min)", 
                    size="Time_taken(min)", 
                    color = "distance",
                    trendline="ols", 
                    title = "Relationship Between Time and Ratings")
figure.show()
```

### Display Relationship Between Time and Type of Vehicle

The final step is to examine the relationship between time and the type of vehicle.

```python
fig = px.box(dataframe, 
             x="Type_of_vehicle",
             y="Time_taken(min)", 
             color="Type_of_order",
             labels={"Type_of_vehicle": "Vehicle","Time_taken(min)":"Time"})
fig.show()
```

## Encoding Some Label Value

In this section, I am working with label encoding. This means any string object represents a [**numerical value**](https://hiwhy.io/numpy-complete-guide).

As you also know, my data set is under a `vehicle` and the `type of order` is a string object that is not supported when I train a model. So the first step is to convert all string objects to the **numerical value**.

```python
le = LabelEncoder()

dataframe['Type_of_vehicle'] = le.fit_transform(dataframe['Type_of_vehicle'])
vehicle_label = le.classes_ 
dataframe['Type_of_order'] = le.fit_transform(dataframe['Type_of_order'])
order_label = le.classes_
dataframe
```

If you see that my two columns under all values successfully label encoding. You can also see that the `Delivery person id column` has a string value. But that column is not important in this project so, I drop this column in the next section.

## Split Dataset Into Training And Testing Categories

This is a very important topic in deep learning and machine learning project that split datasets into training and testing sets. ü§ñ At this time I divided my dataset into train and test sets. Because when my deep learning model training is complete than next step is to check model prediction accuracy. This time I am using a testing dataset. üíØ

Always remember üí•: When you build any deep learning model, first split dataset training and testing set!

```python

# x variable store features column with value.  
# Also note that not store restaurant and delivery location longitude and latitude
# Becuse these two column combine of distance column.

x = np.array(dataframe[["Delivery_person_Age", 
                   "Delivery_person_Ratings", 
                   "distance",
                   'Type_of_vehicle',
                   'Type_of_order']])

# y variable store target column 
y = np.array(dataframe[["Time_taken(min)"]])


# If the  above step is complete now split them train and test set 
xtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(x, y, 
                                                test_size=0.10, 
                                                random_state=42)

xtrain
```

## Build Neural Network And See Summary

In this section, I build a simple deep neural network for predicting food delivery time.

![üö¥üèª](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687402174748/dea1e253-5e35-47d5-84c6-7f0208346949.png align="center")

![‚è±](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687402175663/d640aaaa-d24f-4f4b-9496-c43732ef6829.png align="center")

At that time I am using **TensorFlow** for creating deep neural networks. You can also use **PyTorch** and other frameworks which suitable for you.

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128,return_sequences=True,input_shape=(xtrain.shape[1],1)))
model.add(GRU(128,return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(64))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.summary()
```

![Deep leanring model summary google colab output](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687402176736/003f1699-ff29-4d8d-aa1a-85a214f688ec.png align="center")

### Model Compile And Train

When the model architecture is ready now move on compile and train them with the training dataset.

$$ü§ñ$$

```python
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
               loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(xtrain,ytrain,batch_size=1,epochs=9)
```

### Model Evaluate

Once the model trains successfully now time to evaluate the model with a testing dataset. It checks for model performance on unseen data.

$$üíØ$$

```python
model.evaluate(xtest,ytest)

# OUTPUT üîª
# 143/143 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 54.6020
# 54.60203552246094
```

### Predict Some Demo Examples

At this time I input some required values and the model predicts the actual time to take for delivery successful. ‚è±Ô∏èü§ñ

```python
print("Real Time Food Delivery Time Prediction")
age = int(input("Age of Delivery Partner: "))
rating = float(input("Ratings of Previous Deliveries: "))
total_distance = float(input("Total Distance: "))
type_vehicle = int(input('''Type Of Vehicle Options \n(0) bicycle \n(1) electric scooter \n(2) motorcycle \n(3) scooter
             Choose One of these: ''')) 
type_order = int(input('''\nType Of Order Options \n(0) Buffet \n(1) Drink \n(2) Meal \n(3) Snack 
              Choose One Of these: ''')) 
features = np.array([[age, rating, total_distance,type_vehicle,type_order]])
print("\nPredicted Delivery Time in Minutes = ", round(float(model.predict(features))))
```
