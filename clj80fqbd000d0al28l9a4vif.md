In this short article, you learn the most important concepts in [**deep learning**](https://hiwhy.io/complete-deep-learning-guide) Underfitting and Overfitting. This is an **end-to-end** guide so you don’t need any previous knowledge to understand this concept. If you have questions comment now below.

Keep reading !💥

This is the most important concept in deep learning (**underfitting, overfitting**). I called this <s>bug</s> 💩in our model. It happens all the time when building deep learning models. In my opinion is good because, when I find some bug in my model I learn something new.🔰

## What Is Underfitting

Underfitting means, the model you build is so simple fails to learn **‘training data’**. One example is you use a single perceptron to classify (dog, cat ). Let’s see the below image so you understand better.

![Matplotlib image show Underfiting example ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687401904603/0ca8b5fa-cecd-4425-9302-9583b083f2b6.png align="center")

Note ❌— Underfitting is a simple term model don’t learn features in training data.

## What Is **Overfitting**

If you understand **Underfitting** then **Overfitting** is very easy to understand because it’s the opposite thing. Let me explain first!

Overfitting happens when you build a too-complex model instead of learning training data it’s actually **memorize** training data. This time model performs very well on the **training data** but fails to predict **new data** it hasn’t seen before. 😭

I hope you understand the meaning of these two things in deep learning, if you don’t not a problem because I share with you one story so you understand this concept fast and remember a lifetime. 📜

### One Boy Two Thing Happen – Underfitting & Overfitting

![Two boy green tshirt](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687401910729/b35f1b34-aca0-4d09-9336-7c8c68cc53a1.png align="left")

This story starts with one **‘Student’** 👨🏻‍🎓👩🏻‍🎓 studying for an exam💯.

* **Underfitting happens** — When a student doesn’t study enough so fails to the exam.😭
    
* **Overfitting happens** — The same student this time memorizes the study material🧾 without understanding the concept. And this time he pass the exam but, when a teacher asked outside of the exam paper this student don’t have answers because he memorize the answers in the studying material not understand the concept.
    
    * **Example💥**— Same thing happens today most of all people come to deep learning focus on learning frameworks ( [***TensorFlow***](https://www.tensorflow.org/)***,*** [***PyTorch***](https://pytorch.org/)***,*** [***Jax***](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) ) not the concept of Deep learning so when a new framework comes, for this type of people hard to learn another framework.
        

I hope you understand these two concepts at this moment. If not, don’t worry one more time.

Note🔥:

* If the model is doing very well on the training dataset but poorly on the validation set, it means **‘Overfitting’**. Here is the example remember, if the **training error** is 1% and **‘validaton\_error’** 10%…
    
* Or the same thing the opposite model performs badly on the training set it’s called **‘Underfitting’**. For example if the **train\_error** is 24% and **val\_error** is 25%
    

### One Image One Model Change The World

Building a model is a very long process but it makes me happy all the time. Because I know making a good brain is not easy but hope is important. In the example below I will show you which type of model is important.

I am really happy to answer your question. Here is my advice for people who don’t understand, learn alone, make a list of questions, and write code.</div>
